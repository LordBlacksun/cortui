My personal thanks go to everyone contributing to this project, specifically the custom HUDs created by Parcival, Raveen, FlingPu and Bunnywabbit.

Based on Ksero's HUD modification, making use of his excellent documentation of the .mdl files.

Original logo design by Newtype, logo modifications by Sp4wn, favicon by Loriana.
